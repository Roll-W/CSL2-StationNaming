# Station Naming

This is a mod for `Cities: Skylines 2` that allows you naming your
transport stations and stops automatically.

This mod should be compatible with other auto naming mods, but you should
check the mod settings to avoid conflicts.

## Features

- Automatically name your transport stations and stops.
- Customizable naming rules.
- Could generate names from the surrounding buildings or roads.

Note: I haven't found a way to keep the update information in the saves, so
after you load a save, their names can't be updated automatically anymore,
unless you manually select the name to let the mod add update information.

## Settings

Except the showing settings, you could also customize the naming rules in the
mod setting file where is located at
`AppData/LocalLow/Colossal Order/Cities Skylines II/RollW_StationNaming.coc`.

You could change the naming format for the intersection and set your own prefix
and suffix for the station names.


RollW_StationNaming

{

"IntersectionNamingFormat": "{0} &amp; {1}", // The naming format for intersection

"Prefix": " ", // Set your own prefix here

"Suffix": " ", // Set your own suffix here

}


## Translations

- Simplified Chinese (简体中文)
- Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)
